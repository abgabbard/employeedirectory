  ## Description

  The Employee Tracker & Search is a React application for our Full Stack Coding Bootcamp at University of Arizona. This is our first React homework and required the use of an API to pull randomly generated users and names. This populates the React application with users from [Random User Generator](https://randomuser.me/) to search and sort through. The purpose of building this application was to practice using Components and React State / Hooks. The employee directory is a simple table that can be searched by using the search bar and sorted by clicking on one of the columns.

  ## Installation

  This application is deployed to the following link so no installation is required to use it. However, if you would like to clone this repo you can do so and install the required depenencies in order to run the application locally or build your own Employee Tracker using this code!
